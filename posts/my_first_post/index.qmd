## Travel Log June 2023

**Page Last Updated: 9th March, 2024**

This is an online travel journal logging my solo traveling days.

In June 2023, I flew to Europe for the first time and visited a few popular countries. Below are photos from my trip, taken in Switzerland, UK, France, and Italy.

The summer was warm and I was sweaty. I only brought 3 pairs of clothing and almost always walked upwards of 20k steps a day. But it was the most I could afford with the money I earned in a part-time Cafe-Batista job. Later, after I finished my internship at RBC, I had more money to spare and was able to travel to Europe again in the winter. (See my other post for photos) But the experience is fun and unlike any other trips I have been on, where I stayed at gorgeous hotels with my parents. It was less sight-seeing or shopping and more walking around the city and getting to know the area. It was good.

Transit flight to Dublin landed me in Zurich, Switzerland. The swans are beautiful but not very nice :(

After a night in Dublin, I made my way to Italy. I planned on slowing traveling my way up the continent with ground transits. (This is not because I dislike flights, simply because it saves time and money. I booked quite a few overnight trains and buses to save money. NOT a good idea in retrospect)

I officially started my trip in Venice, where I realized I booked my hotel in late June instead of lat May. It was pitch dark when I arrived at the docks and I had to book a same-day hotel on the spot. Not the most encouraging start of the trip :)

I left Venice via an Italo train on the second afternoon. The train deposited me in Rome at 6a.m. the next day. The morning sun painted over the Roman architectures, casting a hint of holiness. I had breakfast outside, near the main intersections. A little bird hopped into (yes, INto) my plate and took my cabbage slice. It's okay though, don't like cabbage anyway :)

Although my first impression of Rome was good, throughout my exploration, I slowly begin to dislike the place. The historical architecture are beautiful and most of the modern buildings are light in color (ex. light pink, yellow, etc), but the ground is often filthy. Narrow roads are littered with garbage bags and the smell of piss, not very sanitary.

I then took another train to Florence. I like this city better, somehow I feel like the history of the place is better preserved.

Wrapping up in Italy, I went to Paris where I did not go to the Louvre. (Was not a museum fan then, during my later trip in winter, I went to more museums than I can count)

London, Britain was my last destination before coming back to Canada. It was as gloomy as all the stories pictured it to be, although the British has somehow constructed the city such that the architecture is most beautiful in a gloomy weather. Strange but interesting.

This concludes my first trip in Europe. It was fun, would not recommend booking so many overnight transit again:)
